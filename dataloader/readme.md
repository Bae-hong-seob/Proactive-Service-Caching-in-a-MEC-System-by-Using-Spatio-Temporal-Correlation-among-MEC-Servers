We are using MovieLens dataset 2019-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-10-31 23:59:59 for training and 2019-11-01 00:00:00 to 2019-11-30 00:00:00 for test.
- You need to change Month variable so that you make datasets for a year each

In case4 and case5, you will create user_mobility folder to record user's position per each time slot.
- case5 : also you will create different user_mobility folder depend on max_speed variable.

In case6, you can use compressed file per gradual change degree
- In compressed file, there are heatmap images that you can use for model training
